This repository contains the codes related to this paper:

Buza, Krisztian (2023): Classification of Sparse and Irregularly Sampled Time Series with Convolutional Neural Networks, 
SIGKDD International Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series

The paper is available here: https://zenodo.org/record/8186573

According to my intention, the code can directly be executed in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
